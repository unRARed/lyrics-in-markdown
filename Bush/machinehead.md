# Bush - Machinehead

## Sixteen Stone - 1996

### Verse 1

Breathe in, breathe out,\
Breathe in, breathe out,\
Breathe in...\
Breathe in, breathe out,\
Breathe in, breathe out,\
Breathe in.

Tied to a wheel, my fingers gotta feel,\
Bleeding through a tar-decay smile.\
I spin on a whim, I slide to the right,\
I felt you like electric light.\
For our love, For our fear,\
For our rise against the years and years and years.

### Somber Chorus

Got a machinehead,\
It's better than the rest,\
Green to red (machinehead).\
Got a machinehead,\
Better than the rest,\
Green to red...

I walk from my machine,\
Oh, I walk from my machine (yea).

### Verse 2

Breathe in, breathe out,\
Breathe in, breathe out,\
Breathe in.

Deaf dumb and thirty, Starting to deserve this.\
Leanin' on my conscience uh wall.\
Blood is like wine, Unconscious all the time,\
if I had it all again I'd change it all.

### Chorus

Got a machinehead,\
It's better than the rest,\
Green to red,\
Machinehead.\
Got a machinehead,\
Better than the rest,\
Green to red... yeah.

I walk from my machine,\
Oh, I walk from my machine.

### Bridge

(unitelligible uttering)

Breathe in, breathe out,\
Breathe in, breathe out,\
Breathe in, breathe in, breathe innnnnnnn.

### Final Chorus

Got a machinehead,\
It's better than the rest, (head, head, head, head, head)\
Green to red,\
Machine-uh-head.\
Got a machinehead,\
Better than the rest, (head, head, head, head, head)\
Green to red... yeah-ee-yea-ee-yea-ee-yea.

Better than the rest, (head, head, head, head, head),\
Better than the rest, (head, head, head, head, head),\
Machine-uh-head-head-head-head-head.

I walk from my machine,\
I walk from my machiiiiiiiii-ee-ene.
