Blink 182 - Dammit (Growing Up)
======================

Dude Ranch - 1997
-----------------

###Verse 1

It's alright, to tell me, what you think, about me.  
I won't try, to argue, or hold it, against you.  
I know that, you're leaving, you must have, your reasons.  
The season, is callin', your pictures, are fallin' down.

###Verse 2

The steps that, I retrace. The sad look, on your face.  
The timing and structure. Did you hear, he fucked her?  
A day late, a buck short. I'm writing, the report,  
On losing, and failing. When I move, I'm flailing now.

###Chorus (his perspective)

And it's happened once again,  
I'll turn to a friend,  
Someone that understands,  
Sees through the master plan.  
But everybody's gone,  
And I've been here for too long,  
To face this on my own,  
Well I guess this is growing up.

Well I guess this is growing up

###Verse 3

And maybe, I'll see you, at a movie, sneak preview,  
You show up, and walk by, on the arm, of that guy.  
And I'll smile, and you'll wave. We'll pretend, it's okay.  
This charade, it won't last. When he's gone, I won't come back.

###Chorus (her perspective)

And it'll happen once again,  
You'll turn to a friend,  
Someone that understands,  
And sees through the master plan.  
But everybody's gone,  
And you've been there for too long,  
To face this on your own,  
Well I guess this is growing up.

###Outro

Well, I guess this is growing up!

Well, I guess this is growing up,  
Well, I guess this is growing up,  
Well, I guess this is growing up,  
Well, I guess this is growing up.
