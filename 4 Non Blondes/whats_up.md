# 4 Non Blondes - What's Up

## Bigger, Better, Faster, More! - 1992

### Verse 1

Twenty-five years and my life is still,\
Trying to get up that, great big hill of hope,\
For a destination.\
I realized quickly when I knew I should,\
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man.\
For whatever that means.

### Prechorus

And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed,\
Just to get it all out, what's in my head.\
And I, I am feeling, a little peculiar.\
And so I wake in the morning, And I step outside,\
And I take a deep breath and I get real high, and I,\
Scream from the top of my lungs, what's going on?

### Chorus

And I say, hey e-yea, e-yea, eh, eh.\
Hey e-yea, yea.\
I said hey, uh what's going on?\
And I say, hey e-yea, e-yea, eh, eh.\
Hey e-yea, yea.\
I said hey, uh what's going on?

Ooh, ooh, ooh... (2 measures)

### Verse 2

And I try,\
Oh my god, do I try,\
I try all the time,\
In this institution.

And I pray,\
Oh my god, do I pray,\
I pray every single day,\
For a revolution.

**Repeat Prechorus**

**Repeat Chorus**

### Repeat Chorus again with Backing vocals

And so I wake in the morning, And I step outside,\
And I take a deep breath and I get real high, and I.

### Outro

Twenty-five years and my life is still,\
Trying to get up that, great big hill of hope,\
For a destination, mmmm hmmmmmm.
