# Lyrics in Markdown

Searching for lyrics on the web sucks. All the top results share the same lousy
data. Let's change that and slowly build a nice, clean database of song lyrics.

## File Template

Filename should be the song title, underscore separated with a ".md" extension
and should be saved inside a folder of the artist's name.

For example, the song "What's Up" by "4 Non Blondes" would have a full path of
`~/4 Non Blondes/whats_up.md`.

### Verse 2
