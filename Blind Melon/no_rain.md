# Blind Melon - No Rain

## Blind Melon - 1992

### Intro

Oooooh, oh, oh, oooh-hooh.\
Oh, oh, oooh-hooh.

### Verse 1

All I can say is that my life is pretty plain,\
I like watchin' the puddles gather rain.\
And all I can do, is just pour some tea for two,\
And speak my point of view, but it's not sane.\
It's not saa-ay,ay-yane.

### Chorus

I just want someone to say to me, no-ho-ho-o-ohh,\
I'll always be there when you way-ha-ay-ake, uhn yea-hah.\
Ya know I'd like to keep my chee-heeks dry toda-ah-hay-ah-ee.\
So stay with me and I'll have it made (I'll have it ma-ay-ade).

### Verse 2

And I don't understand why I slee-eep ah-ohl da-aye,\
And I sta-art to complain that there's no ra-hey-ai-ein.\
And all I can do is read a book to stay awake,\
And it rips my life away, but it's a great esca-eh-hape,\
Esca-hape...Esca-hape...Esca-hey-hey-eh-ape...

(doliah)

Whoo, hoo, hooooh...

### Bridge

All I can say is that my life is pretty plain,\
You don't like my point of view, ya think that I'm insane.\
Its not sa-hane... It's not say-hey-hey-eh-hane.

**Repeat Chorus**

We're gonna have it made,\
No I'll Have it made,\
Ahlo, oh, no-no,\
You know I'm really gonna, really gonna have it ma-hade (yea).\
You know I'll have it ma-ah-hade.
