# Better than Ezra - Good

## Deluxe - 1995

### Verse 1

Lookin' around the house.\
Headin' behind the window and the door.\
Searching for signs of life, but there's nobody home.\
Well, maybe I'm just too sure.\
Or maybe I'm just too frightened by the sound of it.\
Pieces of note fall down, but the letter said,

### Chorus

Ah hawl, it was good, uh living with you.\
Wah hawl, it was go-ood, uh-hah-ah-ah-ah,\
Wah hawl, it was good, uh living with you.\
Wah hawl, it was go-ood, uh-hah-ah-awl,\
Good, good, good, go-ood,\
Good, go-ood.

### Verse 2

Sitting around the house,\
Watchin' the sun trace shadows on the floor.\
Searching for signs of life, but there's nobody home.\
Well, maybe I'll call or I'll write you a letter.\
Now, maybe we'll see on the Fourth of July.\
But I'm not too sure, and I'm not too proud.\
Well, I'm not too sure, and I'm not too proud, to say.

### 2nd Chorus

Ah hawl, it was good, uh living with you.\
Wah hawl, it was go-ood, uh-hah-ah-ah-ah,\
Wah hawl, it was good, uh living with you.\
Wah hawl, it was go-ood, uh-hah-ah hooooooo...\
So good!

### Last Chorus

Oh, ah-ha, it was good, uh living with you.\
Wah hawl, it was go-ood, uh-hah-ah-wahl-ah,\
Wah hawl, it was good, uh living with you.\
Wah hawl, it was go-ood, uh-ah-ah-wahl-ah-wahl,\
Hah-ah-ah-ah-al-wahl.

### Outro

Yeah, you were so good.\
Yeah, you were so good.

(that's right!)
