# Blur - Song 2

## Blur - 1997

### Verse 1

I got my head checked, by a jumbo jet.\
It wasn't easy, But nothing i-is. (no)

### Chorus

Woo-hoo, When I feel heavy-metal,\
Woo-hoo, And I'm pins and I'm needles,\
Woo-hoo, Well, I lie and I'm easy,\
All of the time, but I'm never sure,\
Why I need you... Pleased to meet ya!

### Verse 2

I got my head done, when I was young,\
It's not my problem, it's not my problem

**Repeat Chorus**

Yeah, yeah,\
Yeah, yeah,\
Yeah, yeah,\
Oh yea!
