# 311 - Beautiful Disaster

## Transistor - 1997

### Verse 1

Today seems like a good day,\
Burn a bridge or two.\
One with old wood creaking,\
Burn away right on cue.\
I try to be not like that,\
Some people really suck.\
People need to get the axing,\
Chalk it up to bad luck.

### Verse 2

I know a drugstore cowgirl,\
So afraid of getting bored.\
She's always running from something,\
So many things ignored.\
I might do that stuff if,\
Didn't make me feel like shit\
I'm on some old reality tip,\
So many trips in it.

### Chorus

Beautiful disaster,\
Flyin' down the street again\
I tried to keep up,\
Wore me out and left me ate up.\
Now I wish you all the luck,\
Butterfly in the wind without a,\
Care...\
Pretty train crash to me and I can't,\
Care...\
I do, I don't, whatever.

### Verse 3

I know a drugstore cowgirl,\
So afraid of getting bored.\
She's always running from something,\
So many things ignored.\
I try to be not like this,\
But I thought it'd make a good song.\
There's nothing to see shows over,\
People just move along.

**Repeat Chorus**
