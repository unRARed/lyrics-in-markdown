311 - Beautiful Disaster
========================

Transistor - 1997
-----------------

###Verse 1

Today seems like a good day,  
Burn a bridge or two.  
One with old wood creaking,  
Burn away right on cue.  
I try to be not like that,  
Some people really suck.  
People need to get the axing,  
Chalk it up to bad luck.

###Verse 2

I know a drugstore cowgirl,  
So afraid of getting bored.  
She's always running from something,  
So many things ignored.  
I might do that stuff if,  
Didn't make me feel like shit  
I'm on some old reality tip,  
So many trips in it.

###Chorus

Beautiful disaster,  
Flyin' down the street again  
I tried to keep up,  
Wore me out and left me ate up.  
Now I wish you all the luck,  
Butterfly in the wind without a,  
Care...  
Pretty train crash to me and I can't,  
Care...  
I do, I don't, whatever.

###Verse 3

I know a drugstore cowgirl,  
So afraid of getting bored.  
She's always running from something,  
So many things ignored.  
I try to be not like this,  
But I thought it'd make a good song.  
There's nothing to see shows over,  
People just move along.

**Repeat Chorus**
