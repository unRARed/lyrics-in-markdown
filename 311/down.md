311 - Down

311 - 1995

###Verse 1

Chill, light on my side as my ego becomes,  
A funky child with some words on my tongue,  
I be like in, take of breath, and my mouth gets loose,  
So while I, gather my spit, I dream of juice.  
Have you ever made out in dark hallways,  
Displayed, a kiss, that made your day, I say,  
Play a track from your record collection,  
It's your mix, congratulations.

###Chorus

We changed a lot then, some, some,  
You know that we have always been, down, down.  
And if I ever didn't thank, you, you,  
Then just let me do it now. (Come back in)

###Verse 2

I bet you light up when we start the show (follow me now),  
Very close 'cuz I told you so,  
You know, we glow, because, we throw, sun-rays,  
Yea, we be freaky and we wanna stay, uhh.

###Verse 3

Lightning strikes,  
Yo we be in that violent force, of light.  
Guaranteed to turn it out as bad as dolemite.  
Because we're dope kid,  
Change like a chameleon,  
And the channel, whatever the whack show Real World is on.  
You know we dazzle like ghetto-box, boomin' battles.  
Rattle inside your head, feel redeemed like cola bottles.  
Fall in love with your teachers,  
On the wax, we are self made.  
Check the technique, 311 in LA.

Keep my feet on the ground,  
Keep my head in the clouds.  
Electrified by the sound,  
Comes from the down, and...

**Repeat Chorus**
