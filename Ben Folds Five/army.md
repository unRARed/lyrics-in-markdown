# Ben Folds Five - Army

## The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner - 1999

### Verse 1

Well, I thought about the Army,\
Dad said, "Son you're fuckin' high",\
And I thought, yeah there's a first for everything so I took my,\
Old man's advice, three sad semesters,\
It was only fifteen grand,\
Spent in bed, I thought about the army,\
I dropped out and joined a band instead.

### Verse 2

Grew a moustache and a mullet,\
Got a job at Chic-fil-A, citing,\
Artistic differences,\
The band broke up in May,\
And in June reformed without me,\
And they'd got a different name,\
I nuked another Grandma's apple pie and,\
Hung my head in shame, nooooo.

### Chorus

Been thinking a lot today,\
Been thinking a lot today.

### Bridge

Oooooh, oh, think I'll write a screenplay,\
Oooooh, oh, think I'll take you to LA,\
Oooooh, oh, think I'll get it done yesterday, hey.\
Ahhh, shit.

#Verse 3

In this time of introspection,\
On the eve of my election,\
I say to my reflection,\
God, please spare me more rejection!\
'Cause my peers, they criticize me,\
And my ex-wives all despise me,\
Try to put it all behind me,\
But my redneck past is nippin' at my heels

Thinking a lot today,\
Been thinking a lot today,\
Been thinking a lot today,\
I thought about... the Army.
